  "description": "Teddy of Hope is a charity-driven memecoin inspired by a rain-soaked teddy bear left alone in the cold. Every transaction represents a small act of kindness — a donation that supports shelter, food, and hope for those who need it most. This token is a reminder that no one should be left out in the rain.",
